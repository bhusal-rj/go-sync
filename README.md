# Go Sync

A fast, lightweight file synchronization tool written in Go. Supports local and remote syncing with intelligent delta updates and minimal bandwidth usage.

## Project Description
Go Sync is designed to efficiently synchronize files and directories between local and remote systems. It uses intelligent algorithms to detect changes and transfer only the necessary data, minimizing bandwidth and speeding up sync operations. The tool is suitable for backups, mirroring, and collaborative workflows, and aims to be easy to use, reliable, and extensible.
